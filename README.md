# RecipeGen – PQ1
Jack Beckitt-Marshall, Kevin Li, Yvonne Fang – Bowdoin College – CSCI 3725

This project uses a genetic algorithm in order to generate a selection of recipes based on an “inspiring set” of soup recipes, normalized to 100 ounces. 

# How to Run
The program is fairly simple to run, as long as you have both the recipegen.py and parse.py Python scripts in the directory. To run, type a command similar to the following:

  $ python3 recipegen.py [directory where inspiring set is located] [number of iterations]

The results of each iteration will be saved in a “iterations” directory located within the directory where recipegen.py is stored, and the recipes from each iteration will be stored in a separate folder within the “iterations” folder (corresponding to the count of iterations).
